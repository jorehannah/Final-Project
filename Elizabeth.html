      <p>Elizabeth is an Arizona blonde tarantula. She’s about two now and has moved on from the fluffy baby stage to the long, elegant stage. Her legs are long and spindly, with a torso and a small backside attached. She has eight eyes, but they’re very small. Her fangs are large and furry and can take down a cricket in an instant.</p>
      <p>She doesn’t like to be held – she cowers at the sight of a hand. However, she also sometimes cowers at the sight of a cricket. Elizabeth is not a brave tarantula. While most Arizona blondes are comfortable with people, Elizabeth is frightened and prefers her tank.</p>
      <p>This tarantula used to love her hide, and would stay tucked away for days, but has gotten braver over time and sits out in the open now. She likes to explore her tank and loves to climb up the glass; her owners have lost track of the number of times she’s gotten stuck and they needed to help her down (don’t worry, the fall wouldn’t be far!).</p>
      <p>She gets fed two crickets a week. When they’re put into her tank, sometimes she ignores them, sometimes she’s scared of them, and sometimes she’s on them in a flash. Elizabeth can show her hunting prowess with this – biting and paralyzing a cricket then saving it for later or chowing down right away.</p>
