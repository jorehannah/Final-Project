      <p>Mimosa is a dwarf hamster. She has a white belly and is mostly gray on top, with three black lines running down her back. Her paws are delicate and pink, matching her nose. She’s very small – an apple would tower over her – but don’t think that she won’t tell you so!</p>
      <p>This rodent is very friendly and loves human interaction. She’ll sit in your hand and wash herself, cleaning her face and ears with her little paws. She loves to run up and down your arms and from hand to hand. She’ll explore anywhere she’s allowed, and her owners are looking into getting a hamster pen.</p>
      <p>Mimosa loves to run. She’s constantly running on her wheel at night (she’s nocturnal) and loves her house-ball. That is the little clear balls that hamsters run around the house in – she’s become proficient at finding little areas to explore and running from room to room. She doesn’t even mind when the cat’s out; she’ll run straight for her, often terrifying the cat in the process.</p>
      <p>A fun joke that her owner likes is that her name can be “Mi-mouse-a”. No one else finds it funny.</p>
