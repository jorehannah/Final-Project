      <p>Bourbon is a bearded dragon, a common animal found in Australia. She looks like she’s orange while inside, but in the sunlight she appears a deeper red-ish color. Her favorite activities are sitting on her log, sitting on her driftwood, and sitting on her rock.</p>
      <p>This lizard loves to eat. She loves crickets, mealworms, dubia roaches, you name it. She occasionally eats fruit – she likes apples and strawberries. She enjoys bell peppers, cucumber, and carrots. She is, however, very picky with her greens. Escarole is her favorite, and she’ll tolerate collard greens, but she turns up her nose at mustard greens and turnip greens. She’s actually a very particular animal! She knows what she likes and she knows how to get it.</p>
      <p>Bourbon loves to come out and socialize with everyone. She loves to sit on your lap and watch you play video games or watch a movie – her favorites, of course, are Jurassic Park and Godzilla. She’s very friendly and will sit on your shoulder (or your head if you let her!) or your knee and just rest there.</p>
      <p>She often goes to the park in the Spring and Summer. She has a little leash that her owners use and it’s adorable. She sometimes gets let off-leash, but only in empty parks and when both her owners are around. She can be speedy, but only for a little bit. Generally, though, Bourbon sunbathes in the natural light and eats clovers. She also likes to eat the helicopter seeds from maples, but her owners try to discourage that, much to her chagrin.</p>
      <p>Bourbon is a wonderful lizard and a great companion. She enjoys her walks, her baths, and her social time. She’s expected to live up to 20 years, and her owners are very excited about that.</p>
